#### Abstract

Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. 

To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both finegrained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose **DeepPerception**, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perceptioncognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench, a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. 

Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

#### Key Contributions

- We introduce the task of **Knowledge-intensive Visual Grounding (KVG)** to explore the concept of cognitive visual perception for MLLMs, aiming to integrate their inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities into visual perception.
-  We propose **[DeepPerception](https://huggingface.co/MaxyLee/DeepPerception)**, an MLLM with enhanced cognitive visual perception capabilities. To achieve this, we develop an automated dataset creation pipeline and a two-stage framework integrating supervised cognitive capability enhancement with perception-oriented reinforcement learning.
- We introduce **[KVG-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MaxyLee/KVG-Bench)**, a manually curated benchmark for the KVG task involving diverse knowledge domains and entities. Experiments on KVG-Bench and other fine-grained visual recognition tasks demonstrate DeepPerception's exceptional cognitive visual perception capabilities and superior cross-domain generalization performance.
